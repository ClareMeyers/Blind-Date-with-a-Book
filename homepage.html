    <h2>Welcome to "Blind Date with a Book" — where we take the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover,” literally.</h2>

	<p>Bookstores, libraries, and publishers have been using the "blind date with a book" concept to encourage people to try out new books for years. Traditionally, the books are wrapped in plain paper that hides the book's cover, and come with a brief description and some other clues about the book's contents.</p>
	
	<p>In the summer of 2012, Larson and his brother Bret were searching for a new building to house the coffee roaster for their first business, Opus Coffee, since its current location was about to be torn down for development. </p>
	
	<p>“The property on 4th Ave was listed for sale for over 6 months, and after visiting the property, we knew that it would one day be a good location for something,” said Larson.</p>
