		<h2>Welcome to "Blind Date with a Book" — where we take the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover” <em>literally.</em></h2>

		<h2>About Us</h2>

		<p>Bookstores, libraries, and publishers have been using the "blind date with a book" concept to encourage people to try out new books for years. Traditionally, the books are wrapped in plain paper that hides the book's cover, and come with a brief description and some other clues about the book's contents.</p>
	
		<p>By removing the assumptions people make based on a book's cover image, title, and author, "blind date with a book" can lead to participants falling in love with books they would never have picked up otherwise. Plus, it's fun!</p>

	
		<p>Unfortunately, not every bookstore offers a "blind date with a book" experience, and readers may occasionally find themselves unintentionally repurchasing a book they've already read.</p>

		<p>So, to remedy these issues, we created Blind Date with a Book (the online version), which allows readers everywhere to participate in the activity from the comfort of their homes.</p>

		<p>We've divided all our mystery book candidates into one of the following four genres: romance, mystery, fantasy & science fiction, and nonfiction. So, whether you're a romantic at heart, a mystery aficionado, a dreamer of fantastical worlds, or a seeker of real-life stories, we have a roster of candidates perfect for whatever you're searching for! </p>
		
		<p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>

		<p> 1. Click on one of the images below, and you'll be taken to a new page with books in that genre.</p>

		<p> 2. Once you're there, you'll see a brief synopsis of each book, and you will be able to learn even more about it by clicking a series of buttons that reveal key tropes, quotes, and information about the author. </p>

		<p> 3. Once you've clicked all the buttons, the blank cover hiding the book will disappear, and your perfect match will be revealed!</p>

		<p>4. Purchase the book online or in person, and enjoy your date!</p>
